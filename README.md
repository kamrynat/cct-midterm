Model Structure and Prior Choices:
The Cultural Consensus Theory model implemented here follows the framework proposed by Romney, Weller, and Batchelder (1986). The model assumes that agreement between informants is proportional to their knowledge of a shared cultural consensus. For this implementation, I used PyMC to define a Bayesian model with the following structure: competence parameters (D) for each informant were given Beta(2,2) priors, which favor values around 0.5 but allow for the full range between 0 and 1. This reflects a moderately informative prior that avoids extreme values while still letting the data drive the inference. For consensus answers (Z), I used flat Bernoulli(0.5) priors to represent no initial bias toward either answer, allowing the data to determine the consensus completely.

Results and Discussion:
The model successfully converged with r-hat values below 1.1, indicating reliable posterior estimates. Informant competence levels showed considerable variation, with values ranging from approximately 0.48 to 0.87, suggesting meaningful differences in plant knowledge among informants. The consensus answers derived from the CCT model generally agreed with simple majority voting (approximately 95% agreement), which is expected for a relatively homogeneous cultural domain. However, the few disagreements between the methods highlight the CCT model's strength in weighting responses by competence rather than treating all informants equally. These differences typically occurred for questions where less competent informants formed a numerical majority but contradicted the responses of the most knowledgeable informants. This demonstrates the value of the CCT approach in distinguishing cultural expertise, particularly in specialized knowledge domains like plant identification and usage.
